          We teach programming through African cultural elements using the Culturally Situated Design Tools created by ethnomathematician and the University of Michigan Professor, Ron Eglash. 
          <br>
          <br> Some schools and ICT NGOs in Kenya and Uganda use Scratch, a block based programming tool, to teach students coding. Though the Culturally Situated Design Tools also use block-based programming, we teach elements in the African culture, like cornrow braids, creating a deeper bond among the students

              Hi! I am a Chinese high school student who grew up in Uganda and China, attend high school in Kenya, but I am now stranded in Uganda because of the pandemic. I am a high school senior with a deep interest in ethnocomputing, or the study of culture and computing, and my vision is to teach students in Africa coding through African cultural designs and connect tech with their heritage

              Hello!  I am a high school senior from Virginia. I am passionate about empowering womxn in STEM and making technology equitable. My interests lie in computer science and mathematics, but outside of school I am on the Varsity track and field team and also enjoy dancing! You can catch me either in the kitchen experimenting with new dessert recipes or at the gym working out
